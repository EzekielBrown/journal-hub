            <h1>Product Planning</h1>
            <h3>Week 3</h3>  
        </div>

        Product planning is creating organised objectives for your team to follow to help you focus on achieving your goal. It helps you to identify and measure the progress you have made through the project. Product planning has many layers to it from start to finish. Prioritisation is important to product planning as it shows what needs to be urgently created/fixed and what does not need to be created/fixed right away. Key things to remember when deciding on the more important items were how many users are affected, how each user will be affected, how confident we are to achieving the goal, and how much effort will be going into this issue.<br><br>

        The idea I have gathered from product planning is that it very important piece of development. It is a major stepping stone for achieving what you want for the final product. We have to know who the product is for. It is useless not making something that is not appealing to its current users. Identify who it is for. Identify what our targets are and the time frame you have to achieve them.<br><br>  

        I enjoyed the structure of product planning. I like seeing a clear layout of what needs to be achieved and the progress that can be made. Prioritisation is interesting as you can identify want is a priority and what is not. Prioritisation gives you a clear map of what issues need to be tackled sooner rather than later. <br><br>

        I do not believe that I dislike any part of product planning. I feel like it is a key part of making a product. Product planning shows a clear direction that you want your product to head in. <br><br>
       
        I agree with the product planning. It is key to providing a smooth and clean working environment. <br><br>

        The best way for me to apply planning to my personal experience to that has the week planned out for my study right now. I have time set out through the week for football, assessments, homework, and study. I have set times for football, so I must work around that. I have set time for classes as well to work around. Assessment is more important than homework so assessments to push to the front of the To-Do. Each task has been placed on the priority scale, so I know which ones I must focus on. <br><br>

        A language barrier may hinder progression or the lack of understanding of the priority system could mean something that is not important is getting resources that should not. <br><br>

        Product planning improves my knowledge and practice by keeping a well thought out tight schedule. If I keep an organised schedule and can achieve all my goals in time this will allow me to stay on top of everything. I will be able to meet deadlines set by others in the future. <br><br>
        
        What may concern me is that someone adds tasks that are not completely related to the actual issue at hand. You may be spending resources in the wrong area. Tasks need to be curated so that we do not have an irrelevant task. <br><br>

        They often question I have is that is the task is relative or not to the issue presented. <br><br>
        
        To connect the learnings in my reading to actual practice, I should plan and or make a roadmap before I begin working on the product. Have everything layout in full as itâ€™ll make each step of development a lot easier. There are plenty of resources that can help me with organisation skills.<br><br>
