        A wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, represents the structural framework of a website. Wireframes allow for the orderly arrangement of elements, intending to help to accomplish a particular goal. <br><br>

        Prototypes in product development are playable models built to prove the viability of a concept or process. This term is used in a variety of ways, including semantics, design, electronic engineering, and software programming. Prototypes are generally used to evaluate new designs to improve precision by system analysts and users.<br><br>

        Mockups, or mock-ups, are used in manufacturing and design to demonstrate designs, evaluate designs, promote products, and more. Prototypes are mockups that allow for testing of a design and provide at least part of the system's functionality.<br><br>

        Mood board is the arranging of images, materials, text, and other design elements into a format that represents the final design's style. You can use mood boards to create brand designs, product designs, and pretty much any other type of design project.<br><br>

        The pain point refers to a specific problem prospective clients of your business experience. It is important to recognise that pain points are simply problems. Problems with customers are just as diverse and varied as your prospects themselves.<br><br>

        I enjoyed learning about these topics. I am familiar with using wireframes, prototypes and mockups. These are all great for the development process because they can help speed up development time. <br><br>

        The topic I was not sure of was mood boards. It was something new to me and I did not see it as necessary to the development process. I can see how it can be beneficial but I thought wireframe, prototypes, mockups and pain points are all I need. This is the only thing that concerns me out of all topics. I will need to practice it and see how I find it. It could seem more beneficial than I had originally thought.<br><br>

        Yes, I do agree with these topics. I enjoy the planning and design process of a product. Anything that visualizes and makes the planning process easier is always welcome.<br><br>

        I have not used this out in the real world but I have implemented it into planning one of my side projects. I have used wireframes and I know how useful they are. They make the design process so simple. I have incorporated site maps as well as helps visualise the layout of a website. “What pages go where?”
        I feel like these methods would not affect too many people. It would affect designers as they have a clear vision of what the final product may look like. It would not affect people of other cultures or age. It will only affect people in the design and planning process to make things more clear and easy. It will also affect the number of resources going into a project.<br><br>

        Wireframes, prototypes, pain points and mood points will greatly help me out with the development process. These will help during the early stages and till the end of the development. This will also save a lot of time and cost.<br><br>


        I can practice these ideas by having a look at other websites and taking some of their ideas and trying to incorporate them into my own. There are a lot of nice-looking websites out there with all different features. There are also websites out there to help me plan a sitemap. <br><br>
