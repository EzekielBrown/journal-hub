        Story Point and planning poker is part of the development process. Story points are assigned based on work complexity, amount of work, and potential risks or uncertainty. Planning Poker is an enjoyable strategy to get a consensus estimate and help guide sprint planning. <br><br>

        I did enjoy learning about both story points and planning poker. Planning poker is a fun way for planning your time and priority around a task. There is always a fun way to do a task. Work smarter not harder. Also planning poker gives everyone a voice and can avoid one person taking over.<br><br>

        People may disagree with the time taken on a project. What might seem easy to some may take longer for others.<br><br>

        I agree with any planning and development process. It is necessary to get the job done. If you can make a job fun for yourself then it is a bonus. It will feel like you will achieve your goal quicker and to a higher quality.<br><br>

        During my last job at Anything Electronic, I always gave myself an estimate of the time needed to accomplish a task. I had to make PCBs for several of my major customers, along with making boards just for an occasional customer. The PCBs could be produced much faster, and I could get them to the customer sooner than if I had populated the larger PCB order. I had to decide the importance of the task and take the duration as well.<br><br>

        Story Point and planning poker would have more impact on the people with less experience. The people with more experience could complete the task a lot quicker than the people with less experience. Fewer experience people would find it more stressful while they are learning. <br><br>

        Story points would help me be more organised. Help me plan my time more wisely to achieve tasks. It will be hard at the start trying to complete some of the harder tasks with a tight deadline.<br><br><br>

        <img src="./img/apheader.png" alt="Agile Process" /><br><br>

        Many software development companies are shifting away from the “Waterfall methodology” to the Agile method when developing software. Within Agile methodology, the work is broken down into sprints or iterations. The team decides at the beginning of each iteration or Sprint what can be accomplished within this timeframe and which set of features will be delivered. Once a Sprint is complete, the software is developed, and placed into production.<br><br>

        I like that the agile process is focused on speed and flexibility. Agile methodology responds very well to change and can be easily aligned with the growth of the IT industry.<br><br>

        Generally speaking, I am a big fan of the development side of things. Switching from a less dynamic system sounds great since it illustrates your ability to be adaptable to new situations.<br><br>

        100% agree, and I believe that customers would be happier since they will get more updates and be able to change when the market changes.<br><br>

        At Anything Electronic, we had to do tasks in steps to make sure the customer is getting what they want and see if any other problems could arise. Due to the constantly changing nature of the electronic industry, we had to use an agile management system at the business. <br><br>

        The Agile process would probably affect people who are used to the old style with the waterfall methodology. The change might not be appreciated by some people because they think that the current status quo is sufficient for the time being.<br><br>

        The Agile process can help me improve my knowledge and practice by breaking down tasks and sprints. Sprints will allow me to do organise my tasks and give me a deadline to get this task done. It will allow for a more fluid and organised workflow.<br><br>

        What concerns me is that if a company has been using the waterfall methodology. How easy will it be to get everybody on board to switch to using the more superior agile method? <br><br>

        I just assumed that everyone would be on board with the agile process. It seems like the most logical way to approach the development process. <br><br>

        I can practice the agile process by utilizing sprints more often. The agile process takes full advantage of sprints. Practice by setting up sprints. Many websites will aid with this. Jira is useful. I can practice using DevOps as well.<br><br>
