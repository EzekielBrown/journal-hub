        <h3>Week 1</h3>

        </div>

        In information technology, computers and software are used to manage information. IT relates to everything to do with computing technology, including networking, software, hardware and the Internet, as well as people involved in these technologies. Many companies have information technology departments that manage computers, networks, and other technical elements of their business, such as storing information, protecting information, processing the information, transmitting it as necessary, and retrieving it as needed.<br><br>

        The parts of the IT business that interest me the most have to be front end stuff and a little backend stuff. Web development and programming is a passion of mine and I hope to work in it for a living one day. Inventory management is another area in which I am quite passionate. There are more than a few interesting aspects of the IT industry.<br><br>

        There are so many facets to the IT industry that it's virtually impossible to master everything. The fact that it is so big is a good thing. Unfortunately, this would be such an arduous task to be good at everything.<br><br>

        IT Business is hard to disagree with. One of the fastest-growing industries, it is one of the most dynamic as well. It caters to so many individuals with such a wide range of expertise and experience. Among today's youth, it has already become so widespread that many children grow up with smartphones and tablets.<br><br>

        I used to work at Anything Electronic, which is an electronic company. We repaired and manufactured trailer and car parts. I was the SMT operator, purchasing manager and was in control of the inventory. IT Business was very crucial to the business. The way I communicated with suppliers was through emails and the use of their website. Their website is the easiest way to order components as it answers all your questions. Let me know how much it is, what it will cost, how much is in stock, or if they don't have any, and how long it will take. The IT industry makes it super easy to place orders for components.<br><br>

        The IT industry affects everybody. Every race, every age and every culture. It is nearly impossible to get away from the IT industry. It would have had a massive effect on the older generation as it was less prominent in their time.It was still present but people back in the day were not walking around with cellphones in their pocket. People would not stare at a screen for 8+ hours a day. Because of the IT business, we can communicate with people all over the world within seconds. Press a couple of buttons and we can meet 1000s of people from all over the world.<br><br>

        Because of the IT business, knowledge has never been so easily accessible. Most of us have a small gadget that will give you most of the answers that you are looking for. Whenever I have a mind blank and need to learn something, you can easily google or youtube the answer. Knowledge is power. There are plenty of tools online that will assist to further my knowledge in specifically IT. Freecodecamp is a very useful tool.<br><br>

        What concerns me is being about to keep up. As fast as the IT business is advancing, there could be a point where it moves way too fast. What could be useful today, could be irrelevant tomorrow. <br><br>

        One thing that I would like to question relates to my thoughts on the IT business, and that is how soon will the IT business fully take over. Automation is already prevalent in a lot of other industries at the moment. We have self-service at supermarkets and some programs do all your taxes.<br><br>
