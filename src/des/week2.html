            <h1>Information Management</h1>
            <h3>Week 2</h3>  
        </div>

        “Information management is the process of collecting, storing, managing, and maintaining information in all its forms. Information management is a broad term that incorporates policies and procedures for centrally managing and sharing information among different individuals, organizations, and/or information systems throughout the information life cycle. Information management may also be called information asset management.”<br><br>

        The idea I took away from Information Management is that it is a very broad term that includes identifying informational needs, acquisitions, creation, analysis, interpretation, organisation, storage, dissemination, and information access.<br><br>

        I like the whole topic of information management as all of it seems very interesting. It’s the whole process of IT. From a thought or an idea to the finished product that can be shared with many. I like trying to identify which role I would like to pursue if it will definitely be beneficial to me if I figure it out early rather than later.<br><br>

        There were not many points of information Management that I disagree with. I believe it is necessary for the whole life cycle for a product and key for the structure as well.<br><br>

        I agree with information management. It is good to have a structure for your work. Useful to maintain control and evaluate.<br><br>

        The best example of Information management from my personal experience was when I was working as an SMT operator at Anything Electronic. We had to create products for clients from start to finish. Design the PCB, Develop the product through trial and error with the enclosures and prototypes. Finally document any changes and updates, document how to make it, and how much time and stock, we used up upon creation. This was all working within a team and keeping communication with the customer.<br><br>
        
        Information management could pose some issues. Like unable to fulfill within the time restriction and you must push the product or updates back. People from other cultures may have cultural commitments which may delay the development and affect development time. Lack of knowledge and experience may come into play as well. The language barrier could pose risk through miscommunication.<br><br>

        Information Management is such a broad topic so there are a lot of ways it can help improve my knowledge and practices. Information Management will help me to keep a structure with my designs and will help me to have more control over the product. It can help put me in the right direction. Help me identify issues and learn to resolve them.<br><br>

        What concerns me is how to manage to budget. A lot of money goes into development without any income. There will be a period where you are not making any money unless you outsource for funding right away. How likely is something going to succeed without some sort of exposure?<br><br>

        Something I would like to question about my thoughts is that how long is too long for development. Some companies nowadays tend to delay their release of a product. Anywhere from a week to a couple of years. Also, should we delete very old useful documents that have not been touched in years? At Anything Electronic, I did some documentation when I was instructed to simplify, reduce, and reorganise files and folders. They had some documents from over 10years ago that we irrelevant.<br><br>

        To connect the learnings in my reading to actual practice, I will need to break them down into steps. Create some sort of structure at each stage. Keep everything organised so that if anyone else was looking at it, they could pick up where I left off.<br><br>
