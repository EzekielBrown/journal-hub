        UX design is the process of making products that are useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to interact with. Itâ€™s about improving the experience people have while interacting with your product and ensuring they find value in what you are offering.<br><br>
        User personas are fictional characters represented by your ideal customers. By talking to customers and segmenting by demographic and psychographic data, you can create personas to better your product marketing.<br><br>
        Scenario planning strives to avoid the two biggest mistakes found in strategic analysis - Overprediction and Underprediction of the company's future. When analyzing a strategy, most organizations fall victim to this error. Even if the rate of change in our life is accelerated to a great extent, the future might not hold what we expect.<br><br>
        A user story is a short, general description of a feature written from the user's perspective. Its purpose is to describe the value a software feature will provide to the customer. It's tempting to think of user stories merely as software system requirements.<br><br>
        A storyboard is a tool that helps you visualize your project in advance. Projects starting with storyboards are less likely to make production blunders caused by miscommunication.<br><br>
        I enjoy the more User Experience side of these topics as I am interested in the front end side of things. I review numerous websites and analyze their User Interface and User Experience.  <br><br>
        I enjoy these topics, but reworking them is what I dislike the most. Making sure it is suitable for the audience I am trying to reach. I feel like I can get stuck on one idea and draw mind blanks. <br><br>
        I agree with these topics. It is all key to planning a website or app. It will make things easier when developing. I feel it is crucial to the design process.<br><br>
        I do not have too much personal experience with this but I did do some planning while I was working at Anything Electronic. One example was when I was designing stickers for our inventory system. I had to know who it was for i.e, my colleagues. I had to plan out what information was required and had to plan out the design to be clear and readable.<br><br>
        These ideas would affect people of other cultures and ages. You need to know your audience. Your interests are not shared by everyone else. People have a wide range of interests such as music, food, and videos. <br><br>
        Outside input is crucial in designing a product. Getting user feedback is a great way to develop your ideas. Outsiders have a particular eye on what they think looks nice. They also have ideas that will greatly improve your product so gathering feedback will help me improve my ideas.<br><br>
        I could end up going even further backwards from completing the project if I ask users for input in the design process. <br><br>
        I can connect this tutorial by practising making User personas, User stories and storyboards to products and websites I find around the internet.  I will be using this on my side project. It will be helpful to learn right away.<br><br>
