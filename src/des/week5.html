        Software development lifecycles (SDLC) are used by development teams to deliver high-quality software in a systematic, cost-effective fashion. Large and small software organizations follow the SDLC methodology. Development models range from agile to lean to waterfall and others. 
        The DevOps lifecycle has various phases such as continuous development, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring. <br><br>
        The parts of the topics that I liked were learning about all the different types of SDLC models there are. I like how each type has its pros and cons.  <br><br>
        The part of the topic that I dislike is that I feel like I can make use of a simpler SDLC to achieve easy jobs. Even though it is better to practice using one of the big scale ones. I feel even waterfalls could be super useful. <br><br>
        I agree with the way DevOps is taking things. They took the development cycle of GitHub and made improvements.  <br><br> 
        I can link SDLC to my personal life by any planning process I have done in my life. It is best to plan things out. The waterfall is the most used model I have probably used. I have not gone in-depth with any projects to warrant me using something different.  <br><br>
        This could affect places that are not using a modular and dynamic SDLC model. They would have to fully shift their model. There could be an adjustment period.  <br><br>
        SDLC and the DevOps lifecycle is super helpful with my learning and knowledge. I can take these models and can easily be transferred between different areas. SDLC is super useful to learn and to know.  <br><br>
        What concerns me about SDLC is how easy it will be adopting someone else's model as opposed to the one that I am used to. I could be used to the agile model but then going into a company where they use the waterfall model.<br><br>
        Should I use GitHub or DevOps when planning? DevOps looks a lot nicer whereas Github I feel a lot more comfortable using. I am not sure, but I like the way GitHub feels. I am currently using DevOps on my side project.<br><br>
        I can connect this tutorial by making new repositories on DevOps and going through and practising. I have already started practising using DevOps for personal projects. Taking things step by step. It is very easy to use the product and I am finding it very straightforward.
